Hi here i am going to write what i think or if i say in professional way this is where i am going to plan things or this is my GDD

GAME NAME -> Omega
Tech -> c, raylib, computer
art -> stealing from others {kenney}

Game idea ->
	i am thinking of an rpg game where you have only one chance one health one weapon one way movement but the twist is this is going to be a room gen based game means you have to clear a room to get to the next room and each room will have it's own enemy type.. difficultly and all blah blah blah

Game flow ->
	the game will start from a basic room {shop} where player can choose their starting stuff then -> [game idea] -> in middle there will be chance where player can visit the shop upgrade things...

Idea that i have ->
	as player progress it they will collect stuff so they can use that stuff to upgrade their self and their wapons like
									-> one more extra heart
									-> one more wapon
									-> things like that (i ran out of idea)

How i want this to look like ->
	A big square (room).. bunch of enemies, coverwalls, chests, kill all the enemy, move
